This webapp allows you to do just that, by allowing you to create a static content API endpoint that can be used in your applications.\n\n## How?\nThe webapp allows you to create a static content API endpoint by providing a simple interface to create and edit content. The content is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the API endpoint is generated using NextJS and Prisma.",
